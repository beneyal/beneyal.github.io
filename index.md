## About Me

Hello! :wave:

I'm Ben, a research engineer at [Ai2](https://allenai.org/). I have a PhD from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev where I researched the Text-to-SQL task. My publications are available under [Publications](/publications/).

Under the [Teaching](/teaching/) tab, you'll find some of my supplementary material for courses I lectured/TA'ed.
